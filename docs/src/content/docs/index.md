title: What is claude-code-proxy?
description: Run Claude Code with Codex, DeepSeek, Kimi, Grok, OpenCode Go, or Cursor Agent through one local Anthropic-compatible proxy.

<div class="hero-copy">
claude-code-proxy lets you use Claude Code with Codex, DeepSeek, Kimi, Grok, OpenCode Go, or Cursor Agent. Start one local app, choose a model, and keep working in the Claude Code interface you already know.
</div>

<div class="route-rail" aria-label="Claude Code connects through the proxy to a supported provider">
  <div class="route-node route-client">
    <span class="route-kicker">Your coding interface</span>
    <strong>Claude Code</strong>

  <div class="route-connector" aria-hidden="true"><span>→</span></div>
  <div class="route-node route-proxy">
    <span class="route-kicker">Local bridge</span>

  <div class="route-connector" aria-hidden="true"><span>→</span></div>
  <div class="route-node route-providers">
    <span class="route-kicker">Supported providers</span>

## Why use it?

- **Keep the Claude Code experience.** Skills, tools, hooks, subagents, IDE integrations, and the terminal interface stay on the client side.
- **Use subscription-backed providers.** Authenticate with supported consumer accounts instead of putting provider API keys into Claude Code.
- **Switch providers by model.** A single proxy process routes every request from its model ID.
- **Use Claude Code normally.** Tools and streaming are translated across providers; images and reasoning depend on the selected provider and model.
- **See what is happening.** The monitor TUI shows sessions, requests, errors, models, token use, and throughput. Structured logs and optional traffic captures support deeper diagnosis.
