description: Canonical claude-code-proxy configuration, credential, device ID, log, error, traffic-capture, and service-log paths on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

claude-code-proxy separates configuration and credentials from runtime state.

## Directory roots

| Platform | Configuration root | State root |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/.config/claude-code-proxy` | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/claude-code-proxy` |
| Linux | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/claude-code-proxy` | `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/claude-code-proxy` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%/claude-code-proxy` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/claude-code-proxy` |

Windows falls back to `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Roaming` and `%USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local` when the corresponding environment variable is absent.

`CCP_CONFIG_DIR` replaces the configuration root for the current process. It does not change the state root.

## Configuration

`config.json` lives directly under the configuration root. See [Configuration](/reference/configuration/) for its schema and precedence.

## Provider credentials

On macOS, Codex and Cursor use Keychain services:

- `claude-code-proxy.codex`
- `claude-code-proxy.cursor`

Kimi and Grok use `<configuration-root>/<provider>/auth.json` on every platform. Codex and Cursor use the same file layout on Linux and Windows. File-backed credentials are written with restrictive permissions where supported.

When `CCP_CONFIG_DIR` is set, file-backed provider credentials use
`<CCP_CONFIG_DIR>/<provider>/auth.json`, including Codex and Cursor on macOS.
`CCP_CURSOR_AUTH_TOKEN` bypasses Cursor's local credential store for that
process.

OpenCode Go and DeepSeek use configured API keys instead of provider auth stores.
OpenCode Go reads `CCP_OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, or
`opencode.apiKey`; DeepSeek reads `CCP_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`,
or `deepseek.apiKey` in `config.json`.

The proxy owns these credentials independently of native Codex, Grok, and Cursor Agent stores.

## Kimi device ID

Kimi stores a persistent UUID at `<configuration-root>/kimi/device_id` for file-backed setups. It is bound into the Kimi token and must remain paired with that login.

## Structured log

`proxy.log` lives under the state root. It uses JSON Lines and rotates at 20 MiB. Known credential keys, including authorization, access tokens, refresh tokens, ID tokens, and account headers, are redacted before writing.

A Homebrew service also writes `service.log` under the state root.

## Failed responses

`errors/` under the state root contains JSON files for failed proxy responses. A `request_failed` log event includes `errorFile`, which points to the complete redacted payload.

Error payloads are safer to share than raw traffic captures, but inspect their prompt-derived content and paths before publishing them.

## Traffic captures

Set `CCP_TRAFFIC_LOG=1` to create captures under `traffic/` in the state root. Requests are grouped by Claude Code session and request sequence. A request directory can include:

- inbound Anthropic request and metadata
- translated upstream request
- upstream URL and redacted headers
- raw or decoded upstream events
- translated downstream events and response
- transport or reducer error details

Event filenames use monotonic sequence numbers so lexical order preserves emission order.

<div class="security-callout">
<strong>Traffic captures preserve content.</strong> Header and token redaction does not remove prompts, source code, tool definitions, tool inputs, tool results, images, or provider output. Treat the entire directory as sensitive user data.
</div>

Enable capture only for a focused reproduction, keep the directory local, and delete it after the investigation.
